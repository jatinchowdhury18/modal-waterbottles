# Modal Waterbottles

This repository contains materials for performing modal synthesis of 
waterbottles. Currently we have measurements for two waterbottles,
a 32 oz. Wide Mouth [HydroFlask](https://www.hydroflask.com/32-oz-wide-mouth/color,cobalt,a,92,o,53), and a DAFx 2019 bottle.
We measure with differing amounts of water and stickers on the bottles.

The organization of the repository is as follows:

    Audio/                 : Audio examples (measured and synthesized)
    Figures/               : Plots of waterbottle modal analysis
    Paper/                 : DAFx paper on waterbottle synthesis
    WaterbottleSynth/      : A JUCE plugin waterbottle synthesizer
